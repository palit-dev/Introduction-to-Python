# Getting Started with Python

## Variables
A variable is a *named* location used to store data in the memory. It is helpful to think of variables as a container that holds data.

## Identifiers
An identifier is a name given to entities like class, functions, variables, etc., that helps to differentiate one entity from another.

### Rules for naming identifiers

- Identifiers can contain alphabets, numbers and underscore ('_').

- Identifiers cannot start with a number.

- Keywords cannot be identifiers.

## Keywords
Keywords are reserved words that have special meaning to the Python interpretor.

We cannot use Keywords as **variable name**, **function name** or any other identifier.

        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## Literals
Literals are a notation for representing a fixed value in source code. They consists of the *Primitive Data types*.

### Numeric Literals
Numeric Literals are immutable. Numeric literals can belong to 3 different numerical types: `Integer`, `Float`, `Complex`.

```bash
C:\Users\rudra>python
Python 3.9.5 (tags/v3.9.5:0a7dcbd, May  3 2021, 17:27:52) [MSC v.1928 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> a = 12
>>> b = 5.7
>>> c = 1 + 2j
>>> a
12
>>> b
5.7
>>> c
(1+2j)
```

### String Literals
A string literal is a sequence of characters surrounded by quotes. We can use both single, double, or triple quotes for a string in Python. Strings are immutable. We will learn more about Strings in subsequent chapters.

```bash
C:\Users\rudra>python
Python 3.9.5 (tags/v3.9.5:0a7dcbd, May  3 2021, 17:27:52) [MSC v.1928 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> str = 'This is Python. Here, we do not have characters.'
>>> str
'This is Python. Here, we do not have characters.'
```


### Boolean Literals
A Boolean Literal can only have two values: `True` or `False`. 

`True` is equivalent to 1 in Python whereas `False` is the same as 0.

```bash
C:\Users\rudra>python
Python 3.9.5 (tags/v3.9.5:0a7dcbd, May  3 2021, 17:27:52) [MSC v.1928 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 1 == True
True
>>> 0 == False
True
>>> 2 + True
3
>>> 3 + False
3
>>> (False + 1) == True
True
```

### Special Literals
Python contains one special literal i.e., `None`. It is used to initialize a variable that has not been created yet.

```bash
C:\Users\rudra>python
Python 3.9.5 (tags/v3.9.5:0a7dcbd, May  3 2021, 17:27:52) [MSC v.1928 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> a = None
>>> a
>>>
```

## Python Statement
An instruction that can be executed by the Python Insterpretor is called a Python Statement.


## Indentation
Most of the programming languages like C, C++, and Java use braces `{ }` to define a block of code. Python, however, uses indentation. 

A block of code is a group of statements within a Program that are expected to be executed only when certain conditions are met.

Generally, four whitespaces are used for indentation.

```python
if (1 == True):
    print("Welcome to first code block.")
else:
    print("This code block will not execute.")
```

**Output:**

```bash
Welcome to first code block.
```

## Comments
Comments are descriptive notes written within a Program explaining what is what. This provides a documentation for future programmers to understand the logic behind the code easily.

However, Comments are not executed by the Python Interpretor. They exist just for Human understanding.

### Single Line Comments
Single Line Comments are denoted by `#` in Python. They consist only of a single line that does not contain any newline character.

```python
# This is a comment. This line will not be executed.
```

### Multi-line Comments
Multi-line Comments are enclosed within triple quotes `'''` in python. They may or may not contain newline characters.

```python
'''
This is a multi-line comment.
This will not be executed.
'''
```
