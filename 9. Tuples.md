# Tuples
A tuple is an ordered collection data type which is itterable and immutable.

## Basic Operation

```python
# tuple creation
a = (1, 2, 5)
print(a, type(a))
```

```python
# Accessing elements in tuple
a = (1, 2, 5)
print(a[2], a[-1])
```

```python
# Slicing
a = (1, 2, 5)
b = a[0:2]
print(b)
```

```python
# Mutability
a = (1, 2, 5)
# a[0] = 5

# Tuple elements cannot be modified thus, immutable
# workaround
b = list(a)
b[0] = 5
c = tuple(b)
print(c)
```

```python
# Tuple Length
a = (1, 2, 5)
print(len(a))
```

```python
# Searching
a = (1, 2, 5)
print(1 in a)

index = a.index(1)
print(index)
```

## Adding and Removing elements from tuple

Due to immutability of tuples, elements can neither be added nor removed from a tuple. However, + operator can be used to join two tuples and del operator can be used to completely remove the tuple from memory.

```python
# Using + operator
a = (1, 2, 5)
b = (5, 7, 6)
c = a + b
print(c) 
```

```python
# Using del operator
a = (1, 2, 5)
del a
print(a)
```

## Counting Occurances

```python
a = (1,2,2,4,6)
print(a.count(2))
```

## Tuple Comprehension

```python
a = (int(i) for i in input().strip().split())
print(a)
# Doesn't work

# Workaround
a = tuple([int(i) for i in input().strip().split()])
print(a)
```
