# Modularity
Python, being an OOP Language supports Modularity i.e., breaking down a complex system into simplier and smaller parts.

Modularity allows a program to be:


*   Simple
*   Re-usable
*   Maintainable

## Syntax of a Function
```python
def function_name(parameter_list):
    statements
```

## Converting a function into a Module

We can place functions in a seperate file present in the same directory. The name of the file becomes the name of the module without the extension.

For example, let function, `isEven(n)` is defined within a file `essential.py`. Then, the function can also be imported to another file `main.py` in following two ways:

###   **Importing the entire Module
```python
import essential
n = int(input('Enter number: '))
print(essential.isEven(n))
```

Since, it may be cumbersome to use the entire module name as the means to call a function or data member, hence we can also use an alias for the imported module. For example, the following defines an alias `e` for the module `essential.py`

```python
import essential as e
n = int(input('Enter number: '))
print(e.isEven(n))
```

### Importing only the selective functions

Importing the entire module may not prove to be memory efficient always. If only one or two functions are required from a module then we can import selectively and use directly.

```python
from math import pi, sin
print(pi, sin(pi/2))
```

## Documenting Modules

Docs provide information regarding your module and functions. It can be added by enclosing the information within tripple quotes. For example, consider this module `essential.py`.

```python
'''
This module consists some commonly used functions such as isPrime() and fact()
'''

def fact(n):
  '''
  fact() takes an integer input and calculate the factorial of a number.
  '''
  f = 1
  for i in range(2,n+1):
    f = f * i
  return f

def isPrime(n):
  '''
  isPrime(n) takes an integer input and returns TRUE if it is a Prime number otherwise FALSE
  '''
  for i in range(2,n//2+1):
    if n % i==0:
      return False
  return True
```

Then we can use the `__doc__` to access the documentation of the either the functions or the module itself.

```python
import essential as e
print(e.__doc__)
print(e.fact.__doc__)
```

`__name__` is used to print the name of the module itself.

```python
print(e.__name__)
```

## The main() in Python

Eventhough, Python does not mandate the use of a `main()`, we can still define it if required. Similar to other Programming Languages, the `main()` serves as a gateway. A critical point to remember is that `main()` in python runs only if it is directly executed by the OS. However, if it is imported to any other Python module, then the `main()` will not be executed.

```python
if __name__ == '__main__' :
  print('Hello World')
```

## Few Essential Modules

### `math` Module
This module provides access to the mathematical functions defined by the C standard.

```python
import math

x = 7.6
print(math.ceil(x))

x = 3
print(math.factorial(x))

x = -7.99
print(math.fabs(x))

x = 8.6
print(math.floor(x))

print(math.gcd(3,6))
```

### `os` Module

Provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality.

```python
# Get information of the Operating System running on
import os
print(os.name)
```

### `sys` Module
Provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.

```python
import sys
print(sys.version) 
```
