#  Basic Python Operators
Operators are special symbols in Python that carry out arithmetic or logical computation. The value that the operator operates on is called the operand.

## Arithematic Operators
Arithematic Operators are used for Mathematical Computation.

| Operator |                               Meaning                               | Example |
|:--------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-------:|
|     +    | Add two operands together.                                          |   x+y   |
|     -    | Subtract right operand from left.                                   |   x-y   |
|     *    | Multiply two operands.                                              |   x*y   |
|     /    | Divide left operand by right.                                       |   x/y   |
|     %    | Modulus - Remainder when left operand is divided by right.          |   x%y   |
|    //    | Integer Division - Whole number division without any decimal point. |   x//y  |
|    **    | Exponent - left operand raised to the power of right operand.       |   x**y  |

## Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare values. It returns either `True` or `False` according to the condition.

| Operator | Name                     |                                 Function                                | Example |
|:--------:|--------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-------:|
|     >    | Greater than             | returns TRUE if left operand is greater than right operand.             |   x>y   |
|     <    | Less than                | returns TRUE if left operand is less than right operand.                |   x<y   |
|    >=    | Greater than or Equal to | returns TRUE if left operand is greater than or equal to right operand. |   x>=y  |
|    <=    | Less than or Equal to    | returns TRUE if left operand is less than or equal to right operand.    |   x<=y  |
|    !=    | Not Equal to             | returns TRUE if left operand is not equal to right operand.             |   x!=y  |
|    ==    | Equal to                 | returns TRUE if left operand is equal to right operand.                 |   x==y  |

## Logical Operators
Logical Operators are used to join two Comparison Operators.

| Operator |                     Function                     | Example |
|:--------:|:------------------------------------------------:|:-------:|
|    and   | returns TRUE if both the operands are TRUE.      | x and y |
|    or    | returns TRUE if either of the operands are TRUE. |  x or y |
|    not   | returns TRUE if the operand is FALSE.            |  not x  |

## Bitwise Operator
Bitwise Operators are used to manipulate binary data directly.

| Operator |         Name        | Example |
|:--------:|:-------------------:|:-------:|
|     &    | Bitwise AND         |  x & y  |
|    \|    | Bitwise OR          |  x \| y |
|     ~    | Bitwise NOT         |    ~x   |
|     ^    | Bitwise XOR         |  x ^ y  |
|    >>    | Bitwise Right Shift |  x >> y |
|    <<    | Bitwise Left Shift  |  x << y |

## Assignment Operators
Assigment Operators are used to assign values to variables. Often, they are also used to express various compound operations in shorthand.

| Operator | Example | Equivalent |
|:--------:|:-------:|------------|
|     =    | x = y   | Assignment |
|    +=    | x += y  | x = x + y  |
|    -=    | x -= y  | x = x - y  |
|    *=    | x *= y  | x = x * y  |
|    /=    | x /= y  | x = x / y  |
|    %=    | x %= y  | x = x % y  |
|    //=   | x //= y | x = x // y |
|    **=   | x **= y | x = x ** y |
|    &=    | x &= y  | x = x & y  |
|    !=    | x \|= y | x = x \| y |
|    ^=    | x ^= y  | x = x ^ y  |
|    >>=   | x >>= y | x = x >> y |
|    <<=   | x <<= y | x = x << y |

## Identity Operators
Identity Operators are used to check if two values are located at the same Memory Location.

| Operator |                  Example                 | Example    |
|:--------:|:----------------------------------------:|------------|
|    is    | TRUE if the operands are identical.      | x is y     |
|  is not  | TRUE if the operands are not identical.  | x is not y |


## Membership Operators
Membership Operators are used to check whether a value is present within a Sequency or not.

| Operator |                    Example                    | Example    |
|:--------:|:---------------------------------------------:|------------|
|    in    | TRUE if value is found within a Sequence.     | x in y     |
|  not in  | TRUE if value is not found within a Sequence. | x not in y |
